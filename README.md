# RayTracerDemo
A Simple Ray Tracer in C#

The algorithm is ported from [Luke Hoban's Ray Tracer in C#3.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/lukeh/2007/04/03/a-ray-tracer-in-c3-0/) and slightly "modernized".

- Uses new language features introduced since C# 3.0
- Replaced WinForms frame with WPF
- More efficient.  (primarily struct vs. class primitives, some changes to the math)
